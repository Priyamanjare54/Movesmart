# Smart Traffic Management Simulation  

This project is a C++ simulation of a traffic management system that integrates:  

- **Traffic Signal Control** based on traffic load.  
- **Shortest Path Calculation** using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.  

It provides a basic demonstration of how real-world traffic systems can be optimized by managing signal timings and calculating efficient routes.
